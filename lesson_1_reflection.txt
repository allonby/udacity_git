pros of version control

need to put down thoughts
easy to go back to previous working versions
collaborate more easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
with manual saving you ensure that commits are sensible in case your devs are clever enough


why does git safe the state of multiple files per commit
you want to be able to get back to the complete version of the program, therefor you need all the files in the correct version of the commit


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to see the log and git diff id1 id2 to see the difference between 2 commits, don't forget to scroll down with the arrow key, also q ends the git log


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you always have the latest working version so you can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
we will use git to build our app
