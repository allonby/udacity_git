Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: when collaborating keeping all files local is not practical.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: You want to know exactly how the code changed before altering it further.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: fork: clone ffrom repository on github, clone: clone of repository, branch: alternative "state" of repository

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: It's easy to compare what changes you have made since the last time you checked the remote.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: You would need to sync up a lot and keep sure to talk to each other before updating the code. Would be a lot harder.
